\section{Introduction}
The success of the \emph{Deformable Convolution} \cite{deformconv} and \emph{Dilated Convolution} \cite{dilatedconv} point us to explore a more flexible design of kernel locality for convolutional layers. 
The efforts (e.g. \cite{continueconv,feastnet} ) that attempt to implement convolutional layer on 3D point cloud and graph have provided us new ideas and techniques to do so. 
Following such trends, we propose a convolutional layer that extract feature in a bilateral manner and investigate its power in this paper.
